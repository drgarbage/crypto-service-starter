Provide a basic layout for starting a contract base service


## Getting Start
To develop smart contracts, you need a test chain to test your contract, and a truffle project to organize all your contracts together.

Currently, the best UI for dApp is web UI. Therefore I include a react web project as starting point.

### Optional: Setup a test chain on your local machine.
1. Install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
2. Open Ganache Console and then Add New Workspace.
3. In Workspace Creation Page, click [Add Project], add /contracts/truffle-config.js file in your project.
4. Click [SAVE WORKSPACE]. 

Now you have a full test cahin on your own machine.

You may deploy contracts to the test chain, and navigate all changes on the test chain by using Ganache Console.
